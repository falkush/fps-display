# Setup
OBS must be visible on your screen. The program takes screenshots of the gameplay and compare all the pixels to see if it's a new frame. You need to input directly in the code the x, y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the gameplay footage rectangle, along with its width and heigh in this order.
